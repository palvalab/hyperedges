# Hyperedge clustering - Demonstration

This repository includes a python implemetation of the hyperedge clustering method presented in [Hyperedge bundling: A practical solution to spurious interactions in MEG/EEG source connectivity analyses] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/14/219311) by Wang S.H. et al. 


## Prerequisites

This code is written in Python 2.7 and requires the following packages to be installed:

* [NumPy and SciPy] (http://www.numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib] (https://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn] (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [networkx 2.0](https://networkx.github.io/)
* [community]: (https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain)

## Using the code

The functions to carry out the clustering are included in the edge_clustering.py file.

A JuPyter notebook is provided here as a demo/tutorial on how to use these functions using provided example files.
